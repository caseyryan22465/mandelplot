This micro-project is an attempt at trying to wrap my head around the Mandelbrot set and complex numbers a bit more.
In its current state, this is mostly just code from https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/2358/how-to-plot-the-mandelbrot-set/mandelbrot-set modified to be dynamic. I just added command line functionality, so you can customize the width, height, render progress updates, filename, and output path dynamically.
I plan on programming in the math part of the mandelbrot set myself, and recreating this in C, both for practice and for performance. I am also going to add more functionality, like generating zoomed images, different types of coloring, and a dynamic window to view/zoom in instead of individual files
